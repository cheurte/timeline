# Timeline

Project for BIOTEC, the point is to replace and make easier the possibility to take and analyze a sample at a given time. It is not meant to be put into production yet, it has just been working for a demo. A few problems were also not being resolved:
At Biotec, all the database are working under the ODBC drivers. And I could not figured how to compile them for the apk version.
Anyway, this project is not maintained anymore.
